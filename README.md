# Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests
# Summary: This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.

## Data Description:

## The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

## Domain: Object recognition

## Context: The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

## Attribute Information:
## ● All the features are geometric features extracted from the silhouette.
## ● All are numeric in nature.

## Objective: Apply dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and train a model using principle components instead of training the model using just the raw data.
